    <h2>Great for Broth Lovers!</h2>
    <p>
      There are those who like their soup with tons of mix-ins and those who
      prefer a big bowl of broth—this recipe is for the latter. While Grandma's
      Chicken Noodle Soup does contain all of the classic add-ins, it skews more
      broth heavy than the other recipes, calling for a whopping 12 cups of
      chicken broth. It also calls for cornstarch being added in the form of a
      slurry, giving the broth a thicker, more luscious texture. The broth isn't
      thick enough that you would know there's cornstarch in there; it's just
      slightly more velvety.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups wide egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>12 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>3 cups diced, cooked chicken meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and
        oil, and boil until noodles are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse
        under cool running water, and drain again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring broth, salt, and poultry seasoning to a boil in a Dutch oven. Stir
        in celery and onion; reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables
        have softened, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until cornstarch is
        completely dissolved; gradually stir into soup. Stir in noodles and
        chicken, and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
